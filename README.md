My vim config files. Some external dependencies may apply.

Install
-------

- `git clone` or fork this repo to your `.vim` directory (move yours if it exists)
- `ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc`
- Open up vim and you should be prompted to install bundles, through NeoBundle. If not, run `:NeoBundleInstall`
- You may need to reopen vim, but otherwise, enjoy!
